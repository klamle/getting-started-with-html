  <h2>
Project Stage 0 Notes</h2>
The lesson associated with this project was <i>The Basics of the Web and HTML</i> Much of the lesson material can also be found in the first lesson of <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253" >Udacity's Web Development</a> course. This is important to know since once you complete the lesson from within the Nanodegree portal the link to the lesson disappears. I have yet to find a way to get back to the lesson for review. It is also important to take good notes since they will be used as the foundation for your Project 0 web page.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed the lesson and found it to be informative and engaging. The majority of the lesson was taken from Udacity's Web Development course with some of the lesson slides targeted towards Udacity's Nanodegree track.<br />
<br />
The lesson started off slow and was able to review the roles of users, servers, the internet and so forth in an introduction to the web.<br />
From there the instructor went on to explain<br />
1. File types and gave definition for acronyms such as HTML, hypertext mark up language.<br>
2. Major pieces of the web<br>
3. HTML Tags like <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i><br>
<i><br></i>
There were several in lesson quizzes to practice any new skills and overall I learned a lot.<br>
<br>
<h3>
The major downsides of this lesson was:</h3>
1. not being able to access it again once complete, even with finding the course that the majority of the lesson was taken from. Once complete, the link disappears to the actual lesson in the portal.<br>
2. the videos on image tag were vague and offered no practice<br>
3. Not enough information: I would have like the option to view the rest of the lesson<br>
<br />
<h3>
Portions I really enjoyed:</h3>
1. The section on how the web works: While I knew this information, I found the explanation to be complete but not intimidating. Having attempted to present similar material in some of my own technology classes, I know this is not always easy.<br>
2. The slides on "a href": I had encounter this concept in Udacity's Intro to Computer Science course but it wasn't until I watched this lesson<br />
<br>
<h3>
<b>Still working on:</b></h3>
I have quite figured out <span style="color: red;">span</span> and <span style="color: red;">div</span>. I think I have a handle on what divs are used for but not spans for that I needed a code editor to do this piece shown here. And imagesâ€¦ well I have decided those pictures will have to wait until I learn more<br>
